Two days prior to admission,\nshe was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to\nadmission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain\noxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on\nlevofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and\npresented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.\n\nIn the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was\n100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this\ndespite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.\n\nReview of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,\nchills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,\ngastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,\npalpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:\nChest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with\nexertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally\nrelated, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]\ndemonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of\npredicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of\n67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator\ntreatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with\nbronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible\nair flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive\nventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home\noxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on\nsteroid taper or been intubated in the past.\n2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]\ndemonstrates "mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2\nsignal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres\nas well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to\nthe right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific\nin etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic\nmicrovascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of\nthe normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major\nvascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate\nright maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left\nmaxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal\nthickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic\nor some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally\nnoted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella\nturcica".\n3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]\ngoing for four minutes with a rate pressure product of\n10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence\nof ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of\nthe study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and\na calculated ejection fraction of 84%.

The\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\nlymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured\nby loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory\nphase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the\nlung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,\nnondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower\nextremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There\nis a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the\nlower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal\nmental status and cognition.\n\nLABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets\n300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was\nnegative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas\nshowed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\n\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,\nsegmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus\nsegmental atelectasis.\n\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal\naxis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\nlabored breathing.\n\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\nwith tracheomalacia.\n\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\n\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\nliters, 92% on room air.\n\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\nfollowup within six weeks\' time status post placement of\nstents in respiratory failure.\n\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\nregimen.\n\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\nnormalization of electrolytes.\n\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\n\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\n\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\npneumonia.\n\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\nleft lower lobe.\n\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\nmedical regimen.\n\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\n\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\nwith subQ Heparin.\n\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\n\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\n\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\nfor approximately one hour.\n\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\nprolonged hospital course.\n\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.\n2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.\n3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.\n4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d.\n5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d.\n6.

Over the past five\n\nyears she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.\nIn\n[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure\ndue\nto a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she\nrequired\nintubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked\n\nnarrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with\ntracheomalacia.\nShe subsequently underwent placement of two\nsilicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the\ntrachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of\nchest\npain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to\n\n[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy\non\n[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral\nwall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the\n\nperipheral and central airways with complete collapse of the\nairways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were\nalso noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in\nher\nrespiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion\nwith Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty\n\nwith mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of\nsurgery.\nIn terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent\nchest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any\n\ntime. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and\nstates that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.\nShe currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters\naround the clock.

Per report, patient felt like this with\nprior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible\npneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with\nthis. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram\nstain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew\nparainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on\nsolumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no\nevidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\ncontinued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\ninterimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the\n50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in\nsputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\nafter 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's\nfamily and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\nwould not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\nagain and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\nfloor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with\nnebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\ndiuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\nof anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her\nbreathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was\nbegun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3\nmore days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4\ndays, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.\n.\n# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG\ntube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD\nwhich revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach\nbody, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was\nnegative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat\nEGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved\ngiven abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable\nwith no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the\npatient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO\npantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.\n.\n# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness\nat the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was\nchecked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and\nphysical rehab.\n.\n# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.\nContinued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI\nbleeding (see above)\n.\n# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due\nto hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on\n[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient\nwas extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted\nfollowing the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved\nto soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.\n\n# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\nregarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed\nalong with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\nDNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\ncomfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\nAfter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem\nof discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,\nokay to intubate.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n# Omeprazole 20 mg daily\n# Furosemide 20 mg daily\n# Toprol XL 50 mg daily\n# Lipitor 20 mg daily\n# Folic Acid 1 mg daily\n# Centrum daily\n# Diovan 80 mg daily\n# Trazodone 75-100 mg qhs\n# Melatonin 3 mg qhs\n# [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] Aspirin 325 mg daily\n# Albuterol neb prn\n# Duoneb prn\n# Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **]\n# Zolpidem 2.5 mg qhs prn\n# Synthroid 100 mcg daily\n# Lexapro 20 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
